Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
With a small number of simulations we should get a smaller time except of this is wrong.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 1000 and we can say it good enough.
